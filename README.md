# MiniArcade – My Little Game World

Hey! This is my small collection of 3 games made using Python and Pygame. If you're bored, you can play Snake, Sudoku, or Lane Racer all inside one screen. I made this for fun (and for learning too!), so it's not perfect-perfect but I tried hard. 

##  What’s Inside?

### 1. Snake Game

* Classic one. Snake eats red food and grows.
* After 100 score, obstacles will come to make it harder.
* Game over if you hit yourself or an obstacle.
* W/A/S/D to move up/left/down/right

### 2. Sudoku

* It makes new random Sudoku board every time.
* You can click a cell and type 1–9.
* If you already used a number 9 times, it reminds you.
* Press backspace to erase mistake.

### 3. Lane Racer

* You drive pink car left-right to avoid other vehicles.
* A / D or ← / → to move your car
* Bikes, cars, trucks come randomly.
* Game ends if you crash!



## How to Play

| Action          | Key(s)                 |

NOTE: Make sure you are using Python 3.10+ .


## Why I Made This

I’m learning Python, and I already knew some C++. I thought I’ll make something small but fun. So I put three different styles of games here: logic puzzle (sudoku), reflex game (car race), and classic arcade (snake).
You can change colors, font sizes, or even add your own new game to the menu. It's all in one file so not very hard to follow (I kept comments also).
You can use this code however you want. It’s free. If you use it in your own project, you can give small credit if you feel like.
